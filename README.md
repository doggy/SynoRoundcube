SynoRoundcube
=============

I have using mail station to fetch my pop3 mailbox start from two years ago.
The pop3 mods made was hard code to the roundcube by syno.

I'm not a php programer but I also tried to transport this feature to official release of roundcube(on 0.9.4, I got mail thread function which not work properly on 0.5.x)
Finally, the feature works, but not perfectly, I noticed some ui bugs and it confuse me a long time.

As DSM was updated to 5.0, the MailStation was updated to 20140220-0159 also.. which is corresponding to roundcube's official verison 0.9.5
Looks a very good thing to me, so I happily upgrade my MailStation to 20140220-0159.
The interface is pretty nice, many features has been enhanced...
In this version, syno rewritten their pop3 mods and made it to a roundcube plugin!!

All features looks wonderful, only but one thing lost:
It will not force fetch pop3 mailbox after I click the refresh buttonâ€¦.. looks like syno's guys forgotten it.

It isn't too hard for me.
The bug only takes me two hours to make it normal.
My code added to syno's plugin was a hook, which I think is a clean fix.
